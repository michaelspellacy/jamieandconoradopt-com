<h1>Hello...</h1>

<p>We're Jamie and Conor, and we hope to get a chance to talk to you about an open adoption.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for visiting our adoption website. We first started trying to get pregnant over three years ago and after multiple miscarriages, we realized that we were meant to meet our children through adoption. We are very excited to be adoptive parents, but so sad that our joy may come from your difficult time. We want to do everything we can to make an adoption plan that makes this time easier for you. Our child will know how brave and strong his or her birth mother is, and we hope to have an open adoption in whatever way works best for you. We look forward to hearing from you any time.</p>

<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We went to the same small college in New England, but somehow did not meet until our senior year. Luckily, we managed to find one another, because it changed our lives, and being together has made the last ten years very happy!</p>

<p>When we were first introduced to one another, <strong>Jamie knew immediately that she and Conor would end up together.</strong> She became even more sure just a few months after we started dating. We were talking about how much we both loved the holidays, and Conor talked about how he pictured spending Christmas with his family as a dad. He told Jamie that his own parents had always left out carrots for Santa's reindeer on Christmas Eve, leaving just the stumps of the carrots for the kids to find on Christmas morning. But when Conor realized as a teenager that reindeer wouldn't really be able to get into the house, he decided that when he had children, he would throw the carrot stumps up onto the roof of the house. Conor had already put thought into how his future children could most enjoy the Christmas season. This clinched it  Jamie realized that Conor would always do everything he could to make his family happy.</p>

<p><strong>Family and friends are so important to us and ours can't wait until we adopt!</strong> We love hosting holidays and dinner parties, babysitting for our nieces and nephews, and spending time with our siblings and parents. We also love the outdoors—hiking, camping, and skiing are some of our favorite hobbies. We are both big readers, and try to see movies as often as we can. We can't wait to adopt so that we can share in these traditions and hobbies with our child.</p>

<p>We are lucky that Jamie's work as a <strong>school psychologist and professor</strong> allows her to have a very flexible schedule during the school year, as well as summers off. Conor's work as a <strong>film editor</strong> also lets him have a flexible work schedule, and we have excited grandparents-to-be who live close by and can't wait to help out once we have children. <strong>Our kids will be cared for at home, by family, until they start school.</strong></p>

<h1>About Jamie</h1>

<p>I feel so lucky to be Jamie's husband, because she is constantly making my life better in ways big and small and I know that she will be an amazing mom to the child we adopt! And I know she does the same for our friends, both of our families, and the graduate students, children, parents, and teachers she works with as a school psychologist and professor. <strong>Jamie cares deeply about everyone she knows</strong>, even if she has just met them. She goes out of her way to check on people who've been sick, to remember everyone's birthday, and to offer a shoulder to cry on and a big hug to anyone who needs it. Jamie has so many people in her life, and the way she treats me, and her friends and family, means that we have a warm home and many places to go to that are filled with love and laughter. <strong>Jamie knows how to make people feel loved, and that is a great quality to find in a wife and adoptive mother.</strong></p>

<p>Jamie has many other qualities that make her a great wife, and will make her a terrific mom to the baby we adopt. She is very funny and patient, and good at doing whatever she puts her mind to, even if it's difficult. Jamie also has the "know how" to be a good parent, although she hasn't gotten the chance yet, because she has a degree in child development, and <strong>working with kids and families is her job</strong>. She uses her training in our personal life already—I've seen Jamie get our friends' children to nap when their parents can't get them to, and watched her calm down kids who were about to have tantrums. I can't wait to be an adoptive parent with Jamie...I know she will always make our home a happy place for me and for our children, and will be patient and loving even during tough times.</p>

<h1>About Conor</h1>

<p>Because Conor and I met towards the end of college, we spent a good deal of time talking about what jobs we hoped to have after graduation and in the future. And Conor knew, even then, that family was always going to be more important to him than work. That's why he is going to be a wonderful adoptive father. This doesn't mean that Conor isn't a <strong>hard worker</strong>. In fact, he is a total perfectionist, and I am always so proud of the work he does as a film editor. His colleagues often remark on how <strong>calm</strong> he is under pressure, how easily he brings stories to life, and how <strong>nice</strong> he is to everyone he works with.</p>

<p>So I know that Conor will always do interesting work and be able to provide for our family. But I know just as strongly that <strong>the hours he lives for each day will be those hours in the morning and the evening that he gets to spend with the children we adopt</strong>, and that he'll arrange his work schedule to help get everyone out the door in the morning and to sit down to a family dinner each night.</p>

<p>And I truly don't think anyone could make a better adoptive dad–<strong>Conor is the most even-tempered person I know</strong>, and is good at resolving problems without raising his voice. He's very funny and smart, and also a wonderful listener... all qualities that make <strong>children, and adults, like to be around him</strong>. He loves baseball, and is an avid athlete and sports fan who can't wait to coach our kids' teams and take them to Red Sox games.</p>

<p>When Conor's brother gave a toast at our wedding, he said that everyone who spends time around Conor ends up feeling better about themselves just by being in his presence. And I think that sums it up pretty well: being around Conor is great.</p>

<h1>About Our Favorite People</h1>

<p>We have so many wonderful people in our lives who can't wait for us to adopt children that it is hard to introduce them briefly!</p>

<p><strong>Jamie's parents live nearby, and are two of our favorite people to spend time with...</strong> They are so thoughtful, generous, and supportive. They also can't wait to be babysitters to the child we adopt. Jamie's mom is a retired elementary school teacher and her dad is a kid at heart. When we watch them play with our niece and nephew, we can already picture how much fun our kids will have with Nannie and Grandpa.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie's older sister</strong>and her family also live nearby, and we love getting to be part of our seven-year-old niece and nephew's day-to-day lives. They are such sweet and funny kids, and are great with little ones. We're lucky to have our sister and brother-in-law close by to give us parenting advice when we adopt! <strong>Jamie's younger sister</strong> lives a few hours away for now, but we think having a new niece or nephew might lure her back home :) She is Jamie's closest friend in the world, and she and Conor are very close too. We know we can count on her for anything and so will our adoptive child.</p>

<p><strong>Conor has two wonderful siblings too.</strong> His older brother and his wife have three cute kids, ages five and under. Although they live about three hours from us, we visit one another often, and can't wait for our kids to get to enjoy our sister-in-law's great Italian cooking and play in their amazing backyard. Conor's dad lives up near his brother, and we get to see him every time we head up there. He is <strong>a great "Grampy"</strong> to our nieces and nephew, and is excited to take his newest grandchild boogie boarding just as soon as he or she is ready! <strong>Conor's younger sister</strong> is also great with kids, and wonderful in general. She's one of Conor's best friends and a close friend to Jamie, too. She's already known as a fun aunt, and we're excited to help her continue to earn the title with the child we adopt.</p>

<p>We are also both very lucky to have large and loving extended families who we see often. <strong>Most of Jamie's 17 cousins live nearby</strong>, as do her aunts and uncles. Conor's family is a few hours away, but we get to visit with them all at winter and summer reunions, and sometimes squeeze in extra fun in between. <strong>Our adoptive child will be part of a big and close family that loves celebrating and is very inclusive.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we are lucky to have many great friends–and great friends with young children–who live nearby. Our closest friends from college have two boys, ages three and one, and we see them almost every weekend. <strong>We babysit for their kids often</strong>, and know they will be guides for us as we become adoptive parents. Our group of friends really feels like family—we've all supported one another through many happy and sad times over the years, and we know that we'll get any help we need as we go through our adoption journey.</p>

<p><strong>Most importantly, we know our adoptive children will be loved deeply by many people.</strong></p>

<h1>Our Home, and Our Home Away From Home</h1>

<p>We live in a three-bedroom house with many cozy areas for our future adoptive children to play and read, and are excited to begin decorating a nursery. <strong>Our tree-lined block is a great place to care for a young child.</strong> Because we live on the outskirts of New York City, we have the best of both worlds—a quiet backyard, but also easy access to all sorts of great day trips for children, like the Natural History Museum, the Bronx Zoo, and shows like "The Lion King" and "Mary Poppins." <strong>There is a park and playground directly across the street from our house.</strong> Just down the block is an elementary school, a public pool, a daycare center, and a local library. Our neighborhood is very diverse, and filled with families of young children. We can't wait to join them out on the playground!</p>

<p><strong>We are also very lucky to have a great "home away from home"</strong> where we get to spend lots of quality time. Jamie's parents have a <strong>house near the beach</strong> where her whole family spends most summer weekends and we can't wait to bring our child through adoption to this special place. Jamie and her sisters spent their summers there as children, and have great memories of learning to swim in the family pool, trying to catch minnows in the bay down the block, building sandcastles at the ocean, and getting ice cream on the way back from the beach.</p>

<p>Because Jamie has summers off from work, the children we adopt will get to spend their summers in this magical place, just like Jamie did. It's such a special place and time of year for getting in lots of family time, and <strong>we are especially excited for our adoptive kids to bond with their cousins and grandparents during trips to the family beach house.</strong></p>

<h1>How to Reach Us</h1>

<p>We want to do everything we can to make an adoption plan that makes this time easier for you. Our child will know how brave and strong his or her birth mother is, and we hope to have an open adoption in whatever way works best for you. We look forward to hearing from you any time.</p>
