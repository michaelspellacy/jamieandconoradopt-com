<h1>About Jamie</h1>

<div class="content">

	<p>I feel so lucky to be Jamie's husband, because she is constantly making my life better in ways big and small and I know that she will be an amazing mom to the child we adopt! And I know she does the same for our friends, both of our families, and the graduate students, children, parents, and teachers she works with as a school psychologist and professor. <strong>Jamie cares deeply about everyone she knows</strong>, even if she has just met them. She goes out of her way to check on people who've been sick, to remember everyone's birthday, and to offer a shoulder to cry on and a big hug to anyone who needs it. Jamie has so many people in her life, and the way she treats me, and her friends and family, means that we have a warm home and many places to go to that are filled with love and laughter. <strong>Jamie knows how to make people feel loved, and that is a great quality to find in a wife and adoptive mother.</strong></p>

	<p>Jamie has many other qualities that make her a great wife, and will make her a terrific mom to the baby we adopt. She is very funny and patient, and good at doing whatever she puts her mind to, even if it's difficult. Jamie also has the "know how" to be a good parent, although she hasn't gotten the chance yet, because she has a degree in child development, and <strong>working with kids and families is her job</strong>. She uses her training in our personal life already&mdash;I've seen Jamie get our friends' children to nap when their parents can't get them to, and watched her calm down kids who were about to have tantrums. I can't wait to be an adoptive parent with Jamie...I know she will always make our home a happy place for me and for our children, and will be patient and loving even during tough times.</p>
