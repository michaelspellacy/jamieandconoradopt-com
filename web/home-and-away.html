<h1>Our Home</h1>

<div class="content">

	<p>...and our home away from home.</p>

	<p>We live in a three-bedroom house with many cozy areas for our future adoptive children to play and read, and are excited to begin decorating a nursery. <strong>Our tree-lined block is a great place to care for a young child.</strong> Because we live on the outskirts of New York City, we have the best of both worldsâ€”a quiet backyard, but also easy access to all sorts of great day trips for children, like the Natural History Museum, the Bronx Zoo, and shows like "The Lion King" and "Mary Poppins." <strong>There is a park and playground directly across the street from our house.</strong> Just down the block is an elementary school, a public pool, a daycare center, and a local library. Our neighborhood is very diverse, and filled with families of young children. We can't wait to join them out on the playground!</p>

	<p><strong>We are also very lucky to have a great "home away from home"</strong> where we get to spend lots of quality time. Jamie's parents have a <strong>house near the beach</strong> where her whole family spends most summer weekends and we can't wait to bring our child through adoption to this special place. Jamie and her sisters spent their summers there as children, and have great memories of learning to swim in the family pool, trying to catch minnows in the bay down the block, building sandcastles at the ocean, and getting ice cream on the way back from the beach.</p>

	<p>Because Jamie has summers off from work, the children we adopt will get to spend their summers in this magical place, just like Jamie did. It's such a special place and time of year for getting in lots of family time, and <strong>we are especially excited for our adoptive kids to bond with their cousins and grandparents during trips to the family beach house.</strong></p>
